# Customer Segmentation: Small Business Owners in the United States.

## Overview

In this project, data from the [2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) was used to examine small business owners in the United States and divide households into distinct groups. Small business owners are defined as people with an actively or inactively managed business that make less than $500,000 a year. The SCF is a survey sponsored by the US Federal Reserve. It tracks financial, demographic, and opinion information about families in the United States. The survey is conducted every three years and the focuss will be on extract of the results from 2019, the most recent survey.


After the households have been segmented into small groups, an interative dash web application was created for users to see the effects of changing inputs. 

## The Data

Consumer finance data from [US Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) was used to segments households that have smalll businesses. 

## Data Dictionary

The data dictionary contains descriptions of all the features in the dataset.

## The Notebook

This is a Jupyter Noteboook that contains all the code used to accompllish the following:

- Compare characteristics across subgroups using a side-by-side bar charts, histograms and scatter plots
- Build a k-means clustering model.
- Conduct feature selection for clustering based on variance.
- Reduce high-dimensional data using principal component analysis (PCA).

## The Dash Application.

This file contains all the functions and libraries used to design, build and deploy an interactive Dash web application that will allow users to choose their own features, build a model, and evaluate its performance through a graphic user interface. In other words, this tool will allow anyone to build a KMeans clustering model without code.
